# 1001 Snakebites
Python Flask project in a web app designed to help Valorant players remember their Viper lineups. Currently available at https://dorps.pythonanywhere.com/!
# What it is and what it does
1001 Snakebites is a player assistance tool where players can learn, review, or remind themselves during a game how to do utility line ups. 
# Why I made it
Viper is currently one of the lowest pick rate agents due to high requirements of knowledge in her utility to be fully effective as agent compared to the rest of the cast. Having a simple web-app to remind/teach players to make full use of her utility will help them assist their team to victory.
# How to use
Begin by learn the lineups and throws in a custom practice game as to familarize with the lineups, and then in game use 1001 Snakebites as a reference guide to remind the player of the procedure theh wanted lineups.
# Current system
- Pages for all current maps in the game with associated lineups
- SQLAlchemy database
- HTML page for easier adding of new lineups into the SQLAlchemy database
# Future plans
- Add more lineups for all utility
- Search function to skim all the available lineups
- Filter through lineups based on varying traits (one-way,attacker/defender,utility type)
- Nicer CSS?
